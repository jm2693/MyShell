What The Program Must Do:
    - Run in Interactive Mode 
        - No arguments (not including program name)
        - print "mysh> " at every line (not including external command output)
        - welcome and exit sequence
            - "exit" built-in

Things We Will Need:
    - PID 
        - each process has an ID (every child has an ID)
        - an instance of an executing program 
    - PPID
        - parent of a process
        - multiple processes can have the same parent
        - if you run the process multiple times, it will likely have the same parent
    - Execute with Executive System Call
