What The Program Must Do:
    - Run in Interactive Mode 
        - No arguments (not including program name)
        - print "mysh> " at every line (not including external command output)
        - welcome and exit sequence
            - "exit" built-in
    - Run in Bash Mode
        - ONE argument (not including program name)
    -Both:
        - WILDCARDS
        - PIPING
        - REDIRECTING 
        - CONDITIONALS
        - BUILT-INS
            - exit
            - cd
            - pwd
            - which
        - BARENAMES
        - PATHNAMES


Things We Will Need:
    - PID 
        - each process has an ID (every child has an ID)
        - an instance of an executing program 
    - PPID
        - parent of a process
        - multiple processes can have the same parent
        - if you run the process multiple times, it will likely have the same parent
    - Execute with Executive System Call
        - 


Design:
    - We use isatty(STDIN_FILENO) to determine if it should run in interactive or batch mode
    - run_shell() creates an infinite loop which runs for both modes. it ends either when the user types 
        - "exit" (interactive) or the input ends (batch)
    - execute_command()
